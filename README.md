# Senior Data Scientist

## Profile
Data Scientist with 3 years of experience in machine learning models for CRM and Fraud Risk. Knows Python, SQL,
SageMaker, AWS and key librarys for modelling like Pandas, PySpark, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and others.   

Led the development of two fraud detection models: one inferring for 200,000 customers monthly the probability
of fraud based on profile to grant access of financial products; and another model inferring for more than 3.5 million
customers monthly the probability of fraud based on financial behavior to keeping the access of financial products like
digital account, credit and other products, estimating to save more than 1 million monthly. Additionally, developed a
heavy user model for financial products recommendations, positively affecting 100,000 customers. Electrical Engineer
with a Master’s degree in Intelligent Systems and AI.
